## Eligibility Logic Best Practices

When implementing eligibility logic for programs:

- **Core Subjects:** Always use `combo.coreSubjects` (generated by the engine) to check and match the required core subjects and their grades. This ensures flexible combinations and selects the best possible aggregate for the candidate, rather than relying on raw user grades. The engine generates all valid combinations, so using these allows for optimal eligibility checks.

- **Elective Subjects:** Always select electives from `combo.electiveSubjects`, which are also generated by the engine. These combinations are designed to maximize the candidate's aggregate and eligibility, so using them ensures the best possible outcome. Do not select electives directly from user grades; use the engine's combinations for consistency and correctness.

This approach guarantees that eligibility checks are both flexible and optimal, and that aggregate calculations reflect the best possible subject combinations for each candidate.
# How to Reference Requirements JSON for Eligibility Logic

This project uses a requirements JSON file for each university to power eligibility logic and modal explanations. For University of Ghana, the file is:

```
client/src/data/requirements-ug.json
```

## How It Works
- The requirements JSON is imported directly in TypeScript/React code:
  ```tsx
  import requirementsUg from '../data/requirements-ug.json';
  ```
- The eligibility logic and modal explanation handler use this data to display program requirements (core, electives, aggregate, additional requirements).
- The file must be inside `src/data/` for Vite/React to import it as a module.

## Eligibility Logic Example
```tsx
// Example: Using requirements JSON in eligibility logic
import requirementsUg from '../data/requirements-ug.json';

function checkEligibilityUG(grades, programs) {
  return programs.map(program => {
    const req = requirementsUg.find(r => r.programId === program.id);
    if (!req) return null;
    // Check core subjects
    // Check electives
    // Check aggregate
    // Return eligibility result and explanation
    // ...see eligibility-ug.ts for full logic
  });
}
```

## For Other Schools
- Create a new requirements file, e.g.:
  - `client/src/data/requirements-knust.json`
  - `client/src/data/requirements-ucc.json`
- Import it in your code:
  ```tsx
  import requirementsKnust from '../data/requirements-knust.json';
  ```
- Use the imported data in your eligibility logic and modal explanation handler.

## Notes
- Do **not** import from `public/data/`â€”Vite cannot resolve JSON imports from `public`.
- Always keep requirements files in `src/data/` for direct import.
- The JSON structure should match what your eligibility logic expects (see `requirements-ug.json` for example).

**To reference requirements for a different school, tell me the filename (e.g. `requirements-knust.json`) and I will use it for eligibility and explanations.**

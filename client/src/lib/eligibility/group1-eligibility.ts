// Group 1 eligibility logic for KNUST programs
// To add a new program to Group 1:
  // 1. Confirm the program's requirements match the Group 1 pattern (core subjects: English, Mathematics, Integrated Science; electives:or any 3 from the allowed groups or technical list).
  // 2. Add the program name and its eligible groups/message to the group1Map below, using UPPERCASE for the key.
  // 3. Reference the program name in the main eligibility logic so it uses checkGroup1Eligibility.
  // 4. No need to duplicate logicâ€”just update group1Map and ensure the main file routes the program to this function.
   // 5. Add it to the program and requirements, append to it

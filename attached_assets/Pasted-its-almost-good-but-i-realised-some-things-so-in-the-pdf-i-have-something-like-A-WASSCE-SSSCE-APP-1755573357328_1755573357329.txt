its almost good but i realised some things. so in the pdf i have something like

A. WASSCE/SSSCE APPLICANTS1) BSC. AGRICULTURE2) BSC. AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGYEntry RequirementsCore Subjects: Credit passes in English Language, Mathematics, and IntegratedScienceElective Subjects: Credit passes in Chemistry and any TWO (2) from Physicsor Mathema cs, Biology or General Agriculture or Animal Husbandry or CropHusbandry or Horticulture.3) BSC. AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENTEntry RequirementsCore Subjects: Credit passes in English Language, Mathematics, and IntegratedScienceElective Subjects: Credit passes in THREE subjects from the following options:i.

General Agriculture: Chemistry, Physics or Mathematics, and Biology orGeneral Agriculture or Crop Husbandry or Horticulture.

which means the  1 and 2 share same entry requirement so the parser should be smart on it . also i see that the parser dont take all  includinf the next line sentence of a text eg instead of i. Science: Chemistry, Physics or Mathematics, and Biology or GeneralAgriculture. it will show i. Science: Chemistry, Physics or Mathematics, and Biology or General

dont skiip for example the 1,2,3 below and it chooses only 3 instead of make for all the 1,2,3 . 

A. WASSCE/SSSCE APPLICANTS1) BSC. NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT2) BSC. FOREST RESOURCE TECHNOLOGY3) BSC. AQUACULTURE AND WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENTEntry RequirementsCore Subjects: Credit passes in English Language, Mathematics, and IntegratedScienceElective Subjects: Chemistry, Physics or Mathematics, and Biology or GeneralAgriculture.

the parser showed only one.


note that some programs share same elective requirements but take each program and give it the share requirements  individidually.

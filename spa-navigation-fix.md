# SPA Navigation Fix for GitHub Pages (React)

## Problem
- SPA navigation (e.g., clicking "WASSCE Aggregate Calculator") did not work reliably; direct links or hash routes required a manual refresh.
- Wouter’s router and `<Link />` did not handle hash-based navigation robustly on GitHub Pages.
- Links sometimes pointed to `/calculator` instead of `#/calculator`, causing broken navigation.

## Solution Steps

1. **Migrated to React Router v6 with HashRouter:**
   - Installed `react-router-dom`.
   - Replaced Wouter’s router in `main.tsx` with React Router’s `<HashRouter>`, which is designed for static hosts like GitHub Pages.
   - Updated `App.tsx` to use React Router’s `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components for all page routes.

2. **Updated All Navigation Links:**
   - Replaced all Wouter `<Link href="...">` components with React Router’s `<Link to="...">`.
   - Ensured all navigation uses the `to` prop, which works with HashRouter for seamless SPA navigation.

3. **Verified and Deployed:**
   - Rebuilt and redeployed the app.
   - Confirmed that all navigation (including direct hash URLs and card clicks) works instantly, with no refresh required.

## Key Files Changed
- `client/src/main.tsx`: Switched to `<HashRouter>`.
- `client/src/App.tsx`: Migrated to React Router’s `<Routes>` and `<Route>`.
- `client/src/pages/home.tsx` (and other navigation): Updated all links to use React Router’s `<Link to="...">`.

## Why This Works
- React Router’s HashRouter is purpose-built for SPAs on static hosts, handling hash-based navigation and direct links without reloads.
- All navigation is now routed through the SPA, so users never need to refresh.

**Summary:**  
SPA navigation on GitHub Pages is best handled with React Router’s HashRouter and `<Link to="...">`. This ensures all routes work instantly, even with direct hash URLs, and no manual refresh is ever needed.
